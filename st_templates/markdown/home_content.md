<h1> Phone Recommendation </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
    
<ul>
<p>
    In today's fast-paced world, having the right smartphone can significantly enhance your home experience. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or just looking for a reliable device, we've got you covered. This recommendation system is designed to suggest phones that are best suited for your requirements and need's.
</p>
<p>
    A lot of people don't have the technical knowledge of phone specification, so many of them end up buying the wrong device which is not up to their expectations, so as a tech and data science enthusiast I have build a recommendation system that will help up guide and buy the right phone you desire.
</p>
</ul>

<h3> What to look for while buying phone? </h3>

<h4> Processor (CPU) </h4>
<ul>
    <p>
        It is the heart and core of your device.
    </p>
    <p>
        The processor handles all the task that you perform on your device whether it gaming, watching content scrolling through social media etc...
    </p>
    <p>
        A processor consists of many things, I will be explaining you the most important and that's all you will ever need.
    </p>
</ul>
<div class="processor-content">
<div class="p-content">
    <h5> Clock Speed </h5>
    <ul>
        <li> 
            It is the usually denoted by Ghz in the phone specification.
        </li>
        <li> 
            It means how fast your phone can perform a given task. 
        </li>
        <li> 
            Higher the clock speed of processor the better it is, it is applicable for all the processor with respect to their <strong>cpu architecture.</strong> 
        </li>
        <li> 
            To know more about arm64 which is used in mobile devices like smartphones click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#64/32-bit_architecture">here</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h5> Process node (Semiconductor device fabrication) </h5>
    <ul>
        <li> 
            It is usually denoted by (nm) meaning nano meter.
        </li>
        <li> 
            The smaller the process node the better is the performance and efficiency of a processor. 
        </li>
        <li> 
            Currently the no going process node on which processors are made is 4nm. 
        </li>
        <li> 
            You will always find it near the CPU specification.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h4> Random Access Memory (RAM) </h4>
<div class="ram-content">

<div class="r-content">
    <ul>
        <p> 
            It is basically a component that denotes how many application your device can run in background. 
        </p>
    <p> 
            The more ram a device has the more applications it can run in background with out closing them. 
    </p>
    <h5> How to get the right one? </h5>
        <ul>
            <li> 
                In todays world with applications using AI and so many other technologies, my recommendation is to go with at least 8GB RAM.
            </li>
            <li> 
                RAM also has speed to as a processor has clock speed.. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                Speed of RAM is usually denoted by LPDDR followed by a number. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                Higher the number after LPDDR better will be the performance and efficiency of the RAM.
            </li>
        </ul>
