<h1> About </h1>

<div id="about-content-text">
    <ul>
        <p>
            This project is built with intention of making people under stand and about phone and technologies related to with it. To guide people with which phone to buy as per their needs and recommend them the best and value for money phones that are available in the market today.
        </p>
        <p>
            People are often struggling when it comes to buying a smart phone and end up taking lot of suggestions from different people, eventually leading them to buy a wrong phone which they don't even need or never end up using the features they have paid for.
        </p>
        <p>
            The worst part is people often trust the sales person a lot who is there to make profit for the company and the customer, so my first suggestion is to not ask for their advise and do your own research, and decide for your self with the guide i have provided in the home section of this site. It will pretty much clear your doughs and make it clear for you about which phone to buy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last point, so even after reading the points I have mentioned you are not able to figure it out which phone to buy the leave the rest to my phone recommendation system which will figure out the phones for you, and all you have to do is to provide some inputs regarding what kind of specs do you want in your phone, and you will get the top 5 phones that are the closest match to your desired phone.
